# certificate-writer

I wrote this script to reduce manual work of writing the certificates after my college fest, Banjaara 2017.

A .csv file with names and colleges of all students can be used to get all the information, and create certificates.

## Updated in December 2018

I wrote another version of the certificate writer for Short Course on Big Data (by Prof. Jennifer Widom, Stanford University) that I TA'd for. This version uses a **PNG image** as the original template, and generates certificates with student names on them in **PNG** format. This is available in ``image_format/``.

<small>Note to self: template for this course certificate (and the CSV file originally used in the code) is in ``Ashoka Course Work/Short Course on Big Data/TAship`` on Drive.</small>
